Heroku add-ons enable you to easily extend your app by using other cloud services.
Extend your app with distributed caching using Redisâ€”an open source, NoSQL-style database. Redis
is available through the Redis To Go Heroku add-on.
You will use Redis to cache the number of ticks to reduce the number of database requests. The cache will be set to expire
after 30 seconds. This means that the tick count will only be updated every 30 seconds.

Test Database Access Locally
	cmd -> ... SFDC_hello\helloheroku_v3\
	mvn install
	target\bin\ticker.bat
	CTRL-C

	full v2->v3	
	cmd -> ... SFDC_hello\helloheroku_v3\
	set DATABASE_URL=postgres://foo:foo@localhost/helloheroku
	mvn install
	target\bin\schemaCreator.bat
	target\bin\ticker.bat
	target\bin\webapp.bat										// The process should output "tick" to the console once a second.
	refresh http://localhost:8080/ticks.jsp
	CTRL-C

Test Database Access on Heroku	
	tick: sh target/bin/ticker									// Update the Procfile to include the new worker process
	heroku run "sh target/bin/schemaCreator" --app [app_name] 
	heroku scale tick=2											// Start two dynos running the "tick" process
		// Refresh the page and notice that the number of ticks increments faster now that the Ticker processes are also adding new rows to 
		// the database. You can increase the tick rate further by adding more "tick" workers with the heroku scale command.
	refresh http://empty-winter-343.herokuapp.com/ticks.jsp
	heroku ps													// Verify that the worker processes are no longer running:
